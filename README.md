# Chippin

Chippin is an effective platform that facilitates the sharing of expenses, whether for a trip, in a shared flat or simply for a purchase between friends. The platform is designed to simplify shared financial management and make it more transparent. In addition, Chippin offers the option of creating and managing shopping lists, which makes it much easier to organize joint purchases. Other functionalities include the creation of a financial plan within a group. This provides a simple overview of finances, whether in a shared flat or when traveling. The pantry functionality ensures that there are always enough supplies available. It is also possible to filter recipes, which makes it much easier to select the dish to be cooked.

## Initial situation
There are currently various apps on the market for organization within a shared flat. The "Splitwise" app is good for sharing expenses, while "Bring" is practical for creating shared shopping lists. However, both apps only offer many of their functions in premium versions. It is also inconvenient to use two separate apps for similar purposes. Furthermore, important functions that could significantly improve the user experience are missing. Other alternative solutions are listed below. It is clear that they all have certain disadvantages. Chippin is intended to remedy this. In addition, there is still no application that combines the concept of pantries with recipes. 

## Project description

Chippin offers a new, integrated web application that combines the functionalities of the existing apps for expenses and shopping list planning into a single, user-friendly service. In addition, many other functionalities that have never been combined before will be made available. These include pantry, recipes and financial planning. 

Chippin is therefore a comprehensive solution that makes joint financial and purchasing management more efficient, clearer and more transparent.
